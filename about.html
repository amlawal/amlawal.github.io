        About Me
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            My name is Abdul Lawal. I am currently a student at the University of Rhode Island with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. While attending the University, I am proud to have joined the multicutural brotherhood: Brothers On a New Direction (BOND). Before attending the University, I previously attended East Providence High School. There, I also enrolled in the Upward Bound program at the Rhode Island College. <br>
            <br>
            A few of my interests outside of school includes sight seeing, traveling, and spending some time with family. I am a huge soccer fanatic, having been to a few games myself in the past. I support an English club <em> Chelsea </em>, located in England but compete around the world. I also enjoy watching basketball on my free time.
